# Seasons of Coding 23: DeepCarlsen

The goal of this project is to be able to implement a model for a chess engine. In the earlier weeks, the focus was on learning Python, Tensorflow and Git.   
Now in this week, we choose a chess model and try to implement that system through understanding the research paper.
