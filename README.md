# Seasons of Coding 23: DeepCarlsen

- The goal of this project is to be able to implement a model for a chess engine. In the earlier weeks, the focus was on learning Python, Tensorflow and Git.   
- Now in this week, we choose a chess model and try to implement that system through understanding the research paper.
- The model has been nearly implemented and relies on a paper on [Giraffe](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01549.pdf). This model relies on use of a neural network and training it to be able to perform evaluations on a complicated chess position.  
- The dataset is too large to be uploaded here so I am providing the link here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronakbadhe/chess-evaluations).
- Just run the [tens file](/tens.ipynb) block by block and just remember to change the address of the dataset corresponding to where your file is present.
- At the end of the file, there exists an example where we have utilized the following algorithm to calculate the best move and apply it in the given position.
